## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Chord Library Architecture

The chord library uses a dataclass-based approach for type safety and clarity:

```python
@dataclass
class ChordDiagram:
    name: str
    frets: List[int]     # -1=muted, 0=open, 1+=fret
    fingers: List[int]   # 0=not played, 1-4=finger numbers
    difficulty: str      # beginner/intermediate/advanced
    barre: Optional[int] # fret number for barre
    description: str
```

### Visual Rendering System

Each chord diagram is rendered using QPainter with:
- **Fretboard**: Brown background with silver strings
- **Finger positions**: Blue dots with white finger numbers
- **Open strings**: Green circles above nut
- **Muted strings**: Red X marks above nut
- **Barre chords**: Blue horizontal lines across strings

### Coaching Intelligence

The practice coach analyzes:
- **Chord complexity**: Counts advanced chords in song
- **Tempo difficulty**: Warns about fast songs
- **Transition patterns**: Suggests practice for difficult chord changes
- **User performance**: Adapts hints based on timing accuracy

### Auto-Advance Logic

```python
def _update_chord_highlighting(self, step_index: int):
    pattern = self.patterns.get(self.current_section.pattern)
    steps_per_bar = pattern.steps_per_bar
    current_bar = (step_index // steps_per_bar) % len(self.current_section.chords)
    self.chord_display.highlight_chord(current_bar)
```

## 📚 Song Database Integration

The system works with the existing YAML song database structure:

```yaml
- title: "Группа крови"
  artist: "Кино"
  bpm: 92
  time_sig: [4,4]
  pattern_id: "rock_8"
  progression: ["Am", "F", "G", "C"]
  structure:
    verse:
      chords: ["Am", "F", "G", "C"]
      pattern: "rock_8"
      bars: 4
      repeat: 2
  difficulty: "beginner"
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After using Songs mode, novice guitarists will be able to:

1. **Identify Chord Shapes**: Recognize common chord fingerings visually
2. **Understand Song Structure**: Learn typical verse/chorus patterns
3. **Develop Rhythm Skills**: Practice strumming patterns with metronome
4. **Build Repertoire**: Master complete songs from Russian rock catalog
5. **Progress Systematically**: Advance from simple to complex songs

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential expansions for Songs mode:

- **Lyrics Display**: Show song lyrics synchronized with chords
- **Recording Feature**: Record practice sessions for self-evaluation
- **Progress Tracking**: Save completion status and accuracy scores
- **Custom Playlists**: Create practice sets organized by difficulty
- **Slow-Motion Practice**: Frame-by-frame chord change practice
- **Community Features**: Share progress and compare with other learners

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Beginner Learning Path
```
Day 1-3: "Выхода нет" (Em-G-D-C) - All open chords
Day 4-7: "Кукушка" (Am-G-Em-Am) - Basic minor progression  
Day 8-14: "Группа крови" (Am-F-G-C) - Introduces F barre
Week 3+: "Владимирский централ" - Complex rhythms
```

### Practice Session Structure
```
1. Select song → Coach analyzes difficulty
2. Review chord diagrams → Practice transitions
3. Start at 60% tempo → Gradually increase
4. Use auto-advance → Experience full song
5. Coach provides feedback → Adjust technique
```

This implementation transforms GStrummer from a rhythm trainer into a comprehensive guitar learning platform, specifically designed to bridge the gap between learning chords and playing complete songs.
